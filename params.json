(code = 101)\r\nThis error is thrown when MXProviderManager can't find any valid MXProvider class inside providers dir. <br />\r\nThis should never happen, unless you delete or rename everything in providers dir.\r\n\r\n#### Email format is not valid. (code = 201)\r\nThis error is thrown when you pass invalid string to search(). It doesn't do anything smarter than check if <br />\r\nformat is user@domain.tld`. It doesn't check mail servers for valid recipient.\r\n\r\n#### Email domain does not exist. (code = 202)\r\nThis error is thrown when email domain doesn't resolve to any mxHosts. You could catch user typos with this error. <br />\r\n    \r\n# Contribute\r\n\r\nContribution is more than welcome :) <br />\r\nFork it, make it better, run tests (`codecept run`) and create pull request.\r\n\r\n# Questions, problems?\r\n\r\nPlease open issue, I'll do my best to answer ASAP.\r\n\r\n# This repo is better because of this people :heart:\r\n\r\nThank you... <br />\r\nMarko Kruljac (@krukru) <br />\r\nSlaven Vincetic (@slaven-ii) <br />\r\nTony Mrakovcic (@tonymrakovcic) <br />\r\n\r\n# License\r\n[MIT License](LICENSE)",
